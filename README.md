# Algorithmics-and-Structured-Programming
In this course, students will learn the advanced concepts of C programming, including the use of compiling and editing tools, implementing subroutines and functions, using standard libraries, implementing loops, performing automated tests, handling arrays and structured data types, and using input and output methods. 

Content

    Tools: This project demonstrates the use of C editors and compilers. The code shows a program that generates the multiplication table from a number entered by the user.

    Subroutines: This project demonstrates how to implement subroutines in C. The code includes two subroutines that convert temperatures between degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.

    Functions: Pending project.

    Libraries: Pending project.

    Cycles: Pending project.

    Tests: Pending project.

    Arrangements: Pending project.

    Structured types: Pending project.

    Input and output: Pending project.
